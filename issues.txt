- "chu mingw64" outputs nothing even when a file like this exists:

	win/chuleta_install_additional_program_to_mingw64.txt
	
	yet the file is found when using other keywords, line "chu install addi"

- "chu users" will output every existing chuleta because it matches the base directory path stored 
	in the locate database, for example: /c/Users/ChuckNorris/chuleta/chuleta-data
