if no repos in config file, do an old-style update
for every repo in config file
	cd into repo
	if current branch is not master, then fail
	if master branch is not clean, then fail
	get the list of changes (only A and D) between since last save point (commit hash in config file)
	convert the list into a script of DMLs with an explicit transaction
	run DML script
	
	
git diff-tree --name-status -r HEAD~1..HEAD	


now we have to deal with duplicating paths in db
	answer: delete before insert
commit name or date?
	answer: usa tags instead
check if any DML was genereted (any changes found)
	answer: redirect to a temp file and check whether some change was found
manage if any repo is missing the last tag
	answer: catch error, suggest solutions and abort
manage if GIT_INTEGRATION but no LAST_GIT_TAG value in DB (this calls for a full update before starting using git integration)
